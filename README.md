# Personal-Loans-MS-Excel
_This project contains the Bank Personal Loans Dataset and it has been solved using MS Excel.
In this Data Analysis Project, a comprehensive dataset of about 5000 existing customersâ€™ details from the HBFC Bank were given. 
To refine its Personal Loan outreach, this dataset was taken into consideration and the analysis were done.
This dataset consists of multiple factors, including not only demographic details such as age and income but also insights into each customer's existing relationship with the bank, denoted by factors like existing mortgages and accounts.
Crucially, the dataset highlighted customer responses to the bank's previous personal loan campaign.
As an external consultant, the primary objective was to analyze the data and finding the underlying patterns and correlations.
Preliminary analysis indicated that certain factors and pre-existing bank relationships had a notable influence on a customer's inclination towards personal loans.
The insights extracted from this exploration are suggested to empower the bank.
By targeting individuals who consists of a higher chance for loan acquisition, based on the identified parameters, the bank can optimize its marketing strategies, ensuring both efficiency and efficacy in future loan campaigns.
This targeted approach not only promises reduction of the total spent on the campaign, if might be held by next time but also provides more personalized customer banking experience._
